# Home-Automation-System-Using-Voice-Control
-----
The aim of this project is to develop a  Prototype Model for controlling certain tasks by just the use of voice.

# Libraries used:-

-----
- **SoftwareSerial.h**

The SoftwareSerial library allows serial communication on other digital pins of an Arduino board, using software to replicate the functionality (hence the name "SoftwareSerial"). It is possible to have multiple software serial ports with speeds up to 115200 bps. A parameter enables inverted signaling for devices which require that protocol.

- **Arduino UNO**

![](Aspose.Words.b648ff4b-4b75-4729-8136-a9416eb3a05e.002.png)

Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

- **Breadboard**

![](Aspose.Words.b648ff4b-4b75-4729-8136-a9416eb3a05e.003.png)

A breadboard, solderless breadboard, or protoboard is a construction base used to build semi-permanent [prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_prototype) of [electronic circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuit). Unlike a [perfboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfboard) or [stripboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard), breadboards do not require [soldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering) or destruction of tracks and are hence reusable. For this reason, breadboards are also popular with students and in technological education.

- **330 ohm (Ω) resistor**

![](Aspose.Words.b648ff4b-4b75-4729-8136-a9416eb3a05e.004.png)

Commonly used in breadboards and other prototyping applications, these 330 ohm resistors make excellent LED current limiters and are great for general use.

- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**
